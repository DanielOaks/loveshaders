Little Space Sim
----------------

Just a simple space sim. Also acts as something I can write and test shaders against!

Install with ``git clone https://github.com/DanielOaks/planetsim.git``

Then you run the http://love2d.org/ program with the planetsim directory as the arg. You can just drop the whole directory into the LÃ¶ve2d program.

And with some recently-added chromatic aberration!
