Shaders for Löve2d
==================

Just a testbed for shaders I write to work with Löve2d.

Install with ``git clone https://github.com/DanielOaks/loveshaders.git``

Then you run the http://love2d.org/ program with the loveshaders directory as the arg. You can just drop the whole directory into the Löve2d program.
