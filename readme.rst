Little Space Sim
----------------

Little teeny space simulator, maybe, kinda.

Install with ``git clone https://github.com/DanielOaks/planetsim.git``

Then you run the http://love2d.org/ program with the planetsim directory as the arg. You can just drop the whole directory into the LÃ¶ve2d program.
